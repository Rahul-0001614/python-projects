# Scientific calculator made by using of gui tkinter in Python

1)  Introduction   :-
 
      A scientific calculator is an electronic calculator, it is designed to perform calculations using basic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and complex (trigonometric, hyperbolic, etc.) mathematical operations and functions.
	  
      There are three main types of calculators: basic, business, and scientific. You can't work chemistry, physics, engineering, or trigonometry problems on a basic or business calculator because they don't have functions you'll need to use. Scientific calculators include exponents, log, natural log (ln), trig functions, and memory. These functions are vital when you're working with scientific notation or any formula with a geometry component. Basic calculators can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2)  fuction of Scientific calculator :-

        1.  + represents addition
        2.  - represents subtraction
        3.  * represents multiplication
        4.  / represents divided
        5.  ^ is raised to the power of value
        6.  xy is x raised to the power y
        7.  sin represents sine fuction
        8.  cos represents cos  fuction
        9.  Tan represents  tangent fuction

3)  uses of fuction :-

        1.  Square root -  the square root of 4 so know the answer is 2 . find out the square root 4 so enter 4 and then press the SQRT key so result is coming. 
        2.  Taking power - The key may be marked xy.  Test this by entering 2, power key, 3.  the answer is coming 8.
        3.  10x   -        enter x value then press button of 10x so 10 raised to power in x value and result is coming.
        4.  trig fuction - you need to determine whether you enter the angle  and then sin, cos, tan, etc.so  enter number and press sin,cos,tan fuction 
                           button. How do you test this: Remember the sine of a 30-degree angle is 0.5. Enter 30 then press sin so find result is 0.5.
        5.  cube root    - the cube root of 8 is result is 2. find out cube root 8 so enter 8 and then press cube root sign button so resuit is coming.
        6.  AC button    - clears the entry in calculator and resets all fuctions.
        7.  C button     - clear entry which erases the last entry you have keyed in.
        8.  log          -  the log key is used for calculations of the form  log 10 x .
        9.  x2(square)   -  we can find the square of any number.find out the square of 3 so enter number 3 and then press the x2 button so result coming is 9.
        10. pi           -  pi is displayed as 3.141592654
